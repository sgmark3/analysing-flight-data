# analysing-flight-data
We analyze a dataset on air travel through commercial airplanes (https://openflights.org/data.html#airport) to extract shortest paths between a source and a destination airports based on the distance between them. We propose to generalize this framework to include different attributes of the airports and the paths between them by defining a directed weighted graph. In this exploratory demonstration we assign the edge weights to be the distances between the source and destinatino i.e. flight distance. We use networkx package to do analysis of the resulting network.
